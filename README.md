# PiVision
This is some example code to give you guys a start at programming vision code! The positional transforms for converting the objects position to world space can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14OD7Tcrcbk8X-UzXPx0Zyt1PJQFu05X1uhfqhOkNw9Q/edit?usp=sharing)

## What Currently Works
- Distance Detection
- Positional Detection
## What Currently Doesn't Work
- Pretty much all of the netcode
- Positional correction for rotation
