# PiVision
This is some example code to give you guys a start at programming vision code!

## What Currently Works
- Distance Detection
  -- This work by using triangular Similarity
 - Positional Detection
  -- This uses distance * tan(fov) as a max distance and fixes the calculated center position accordingly

## What Currently Doesn't Work
- Pretty much all of the netcode
